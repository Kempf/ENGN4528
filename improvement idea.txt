For Blue bird:
	runvideo.m
	*frame_blue = CropColour(frame_med,[90,160,100,200,100,190]);
		->frame_blue = CropColour(frame_med,[90,130,100,200,100,190]);
	
	Filter_Blue.m
	add constraint to avoid non-square object: 
		(region(i).BoundingBox(3)<region(i).BoundingBox(4)*1.2)...
		&&(region(i).BoundingBox(4)<region(i).BoundingBox(3)*1.2)
	
	maybe we should add constraint for the ratio between RGB values because the scopes of RGB value is too wide, it is easy to get pixels like [110,110,110] detected as blue while it is actually gray. But Nemo didn't find a proper place to add this constraint.

To avoid non-circle(actually square) object to be detected:
	The constraint to avoid non-square object will be hard to apply to birds that have more than 1 major color on its body.But it may be feasible to combine the threshold frames of major colors.

Another issue: What method have we used to distinguish watermelons and pigs.
